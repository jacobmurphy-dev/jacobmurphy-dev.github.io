        One of our large clients, with approximately 50 employees across two
        levels of their building, experienced issues with their phone and
        internet system. My co-worker and I were tasked with resetting all the
        phones and reconnecting them to the server. We decided to start at
        opposite ends of the first floor, each resetting and reconnecting phones
        as we went.
        <br />
        <br />
        This ensured continuous engagement with the client and efficient use of
        our time. Throughout the process, we maintained constant communication
        with each other and our manager, who monitored the phones remotely.
        During the task, I encountered phones that did not reconnect due to
        firmware issues. My co-worker, experienced with these devices, suggested
        we swap tasks.
        <br />
        <br />
        He updated the firmware while I continued with the remaining phones,
        minimizing downtime. Our communication was generally good but could have
        been better during the final testing phase. After being onsite for three
        hours, we rushed through testing, which led to some phones not receiving
        calls.
        <br />
        <br />
        This issue was not communicated until later when the client reported
        problems. In the end, all phones were reset and reconnected. This
        experience highlighted the importance of thorough testing and clear
        communication, especially under time constraints.
